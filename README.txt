CODE ONLINE
I have put all the code of the PHP Class I conducted 2 times at Prime College online for others to easily view it without downloading.
You can even use it as a reference.

SLIDES - SHEETS
If you want to learn PHP MYSQL in 10 days you can access all the slides to do it from scratch installing XAMPP at : http://geshanmanandhar.com/slides/php
OR at: http://geshan.blogspot.com/2008/12/start-learning-php-with-slides-and.html . You can get the slides online or you can even download it.

HOPE IT HELPS YOU
From the feedback I got from new PHP programmers, I think this tutorial is quite helpful and may be it will help you learn PHP. I sense you will need
basic programming knowledge but this course starts from the very basic. Happy PHP learning.
